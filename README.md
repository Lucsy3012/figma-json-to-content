# Figma Plugin: JSON To Content
Map your data and your layers together simply by naming them the same way and selecting or shuffling the content you need.

### Tired of incoherent random data?
Set up your data separately as a JSON file, load it up and start adding your content meaningfully and coherent, just like a database would. The content of that set stays always together!

#### Easy mapping via layer name
Map your data and your layers together simply by naming them the same way. The name of your text layers just needs to match the key of your object and the value will be parsed. (You’ll find a example at the bottom of the page.)

#### Group rewritting
Overwrite multiple text layers within your selection and any data that’s attached to the entry will be written into layers that have the same name as the key.

#### Choose between specific or randomized data
When you have imported your data the plugin will print a list with every entry that’s in your file. Click on an entry if you need specifically data from that set.

#### Future plans:
* Implement the ability to also link images
* Upload .csv files
