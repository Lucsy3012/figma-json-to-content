# Figma Plugin: JSON To Content
Map your data and your layers together simply by naming them the same way. Selecting specific entries from your list or shuffle through it for a randomized data set.

### Tired of incoherent random data?
Set up your data separately as a JSON or CSV file, load it up and start adding your content meaningfully and coherent, just like a database would. The content of that set stays always together and creates a seamless experience to retrieve data!

#### Easy mapping via layer name
Map your data and your layers together simply by naming them the same way. The name of your text layers just needs to match the key of your object and the value will be parsed. You'll find examples within the project. 

#### Selection rewritting
Overwrite multiple text layers within your selection and any data that’s attached to the entry will be written into layers that have the same name as the key.

#### Choose between specific or randomized data
When you have imported your data the plugin will print a list with every entry that’s in your file. Click on an entry if you need specifically data from that set.

#### Future plans:
* Implement the ability to also link images
* Create and save multiple tabs with different data
* Upload .csv files (done)
